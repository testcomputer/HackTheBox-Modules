writeups and walkthroughs.


About HackTheBox

HackTheBox is a popular online platform that offers various cybersecurity challenges and virtual machines for users 
to practice their hacking skills in a safe and legal environment. The platform includes a wide range of machines, 
including easy to difficult ones, which require different levels of skills and techniques to be hacked.
Contents

Each machine I've completed on HackTheBox will have its own directory containing a writeup and notes. The writeup 
will detail the steps I took to successfully gain access to the machine and obtain the root flag. The notes will 
include any relevant information about the machine, including its IP address, port numbers, tools used, and potential 
pitfalls or roadblocks.
Usage

This repository is primarily intended for personal use as a means of keeping track of my progress and improving my 
skills. However, others may find the writeups and notes useful as a reference or learning tool. If you choose to use 
this repository as a resource, please note that these machines are still active on the HackTheBox platform and should 
not be targeted outside of the platform.
Disclaimer

I do not condone any illegal or unethical activities. These machines were completed for educational purposes only and
were done so in a safe and legal environment provided by HackTheBox. Any attempt to hack or exploit a system without 
explicit permission is illegal and could result in severe consequences.
